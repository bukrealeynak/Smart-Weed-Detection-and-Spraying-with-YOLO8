# Smart-Weed-Detection-and-Spraying-with-YOLO8

In this project, an object detection system was developed using the YOLO8 model for the purpose of identifying and targeting specific weeds in agricultural fields. A dataset was created with Roboflow and images were labeled to train the model. During live testing with a camera, the weed detection algorithm was employed to provide real-time feedback, where the presence of a weed in the center of the video was indicated by a green square. Furthermore, coordinate feedback was generated to guide the spraying mechanism of the rover. By combining computer vision and agriculture, a precise and efficient approach to weed control was achieved.
